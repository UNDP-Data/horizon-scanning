Environmental concerns are now gaining traction because of the economic and sociopolitical vulnerabilities now being recognized. It appears to be driving, however, more nationalism and regionalism , and this can again lead to changes in global economic and power dynamics (eg even if Spain jumps in as a new player of power supply in the EU, it ultimately changes the power dynamic within the EU). You see knock on effects in Asia with palm oil and wheat export bans. Drought and food security fears are leading developing countries to follow the COVID period behaviours of those countries with global leadership power, and take care of their own first...though this will certainly lead to more global instability as the IMF points out (see the article on India). It is also interesting to see the far more direct messaging for UN SG to students to not work for \"climate wreckers\". So this is a strong signal that we are at a critical threshold where climate and environmental degradation, unsustainable consumption, sociopolitical conflict and unequal and fragile supply chains are driving increases in nationalism and more global instability.",

The article argues that  \nBy some measures, recent events look even more disruptive than those of the 1970s. Recent price fluctuations have affected a broader set of commodities. Commodity price rises in the 1970s were concentrated in oil markets, whereas in recent months energy, agricultural, commodity and metals prices have all experienced strong gains. The prices of minerals have dropped presenting difficulty for Mongolian exports to earn a decent foreign exchange. The biggest buyer of Mongolian minerals is China and its economy is affected due to zero COVID-19 policy. Being landlocked by Russia and China, Mongolia has little choice to make significant gains from exporting minerals during tough times.",

The “Bad Student” anti-establishment group posted a picture and strict rules related to student hairstyles at a school in the southern border province; the post has gone viral and generated debate if hairstyle should be an individual's choice. The shampoo brand 'Dove' also picked up on the signal and bought first page of a national newspaper to question that \"when a girl is forced to cut the hair, is it only their hair that got cut?\". A school in Bangkok tries a new approach without strict rules but a loose guideline for students to decide on their own. Rigid rules seem to no longer be accepted by the new generation who has been vocal in demanding for individual freedom of expression and space for diversity.",

The deserts in Iraq and Syria are believed to be the primary sources of dust in the region. In Iran, Sand and Dust Storms have both natural and human-induced sources. While Iran’s central and southeastern deserts have been the natural sources of SDS, the beds of water bodies such a Lake Urmia in northwest (which is dried out due to anthropogenic causes), are new concerns. Sand and Dust Storms impose a broad range of negative impacts on the economy, environment, agriculture, industries, transportation, health and political stability of the affected countries in the region.

This has been most visible in \"Mamaks\" (Indian-Muslim eateries that serve low-priced food and often operate 24-hours), with many reducing hours or even closing outlets. It has also impacted the palm oil industry with low harvest rates due to lack of labour. It is not yet clear if the Government is deliberately trying to shift the economy away from low-value labour, if restrictions on migrant labour is political (due to unpopularity of migrant workers), and/or if business pressure will reopen the migrant labour market.

However, subsequent governments in Maldives have created SOEs in virtually every sector of the economy (banking, transport, trade, telecommunications etc) and the private sector in these areas is increasingly complaining about unfair competition and reducing investments in sectors where SOEs are operating.

The rational path, however, is not always the path of least resistance. In an economy where disposability and linear throughput reigns, shifting the system will take leadership, collaboration, innovation and commitment. From plastics, to electronics, to food and fashion, incremental steps are being taken to drive more circularity into material value chains. It is time to accelerate that progress. The quest for a substantial improvement in resource performance across the economy has led businesses to explore ways to reuse products or their components and restore more of their precious material, energy and labor inputs. A circular economy is an industrial system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design. The economic benefit of transitioning to this new business model is estimated at more than one trillion dollars in material savings globally.",

Yet new physical technologies and digital services alone will not solve food insecurity. There is a need to reform public policies to ensure accessibility of services, provides the kind of high-quality food choices individuals need and want, and builds a stronger food economy for workers and business owners. That demands addressing prerequisites to digital delivery access such as broadband adoption and digital device ownership, as well as emerging environmental, economic, and social impacts of this new system. Digital skills and access to devices are similar concerns. For decades, digital equity researchers and advocates have clearly communicated how a lack of digital skills or barriers to acquiring devices can keep many disconnected from the internet and its opportunities. These results suggest the same skill and equipment deficits—evidenced by lower broadband adoption rates in many traditionally defined food deserts—could become a barrier to healthier people and communities.

However, BSEC still does not have any mandate for contemporary sustainability issues such as - environmental pollution, social inclusion, and modern slavery issues.

However very few markets work as intended and many are too cheap to make a difference. Making carbon markets work better is more of a political challenge than an economic one. Neither lowering caps on total emissions nor covering more sectors requires a deep rethink of carbon markets' design. The difficulty is building and preserving support for measures that make most economic activities costlier. \nCheeringly, however, the momentum around carbon market looks self-sustaining. For example, the EU's \"carbon border-adjustment mechanism\" can encourage other countries to export to EU to bring their carbon prices closer to the EU's. Japan is set to try out a national market in September. And some American lawmakers are looking into carbon market to find a way to use it as protectionist measures. ",

The government has lax environmental regulations that companies choose to relocate their production plants to escape the strict rules, which have come into effect in recent years in the West. However, to tackle the environmental challenges and to survive in the global markets, the country needs to transition from a linear to a circular economy. Implementing a circular economy requires pragmatic policy, technical and financial support for the industries, and multi-level stakeholder engagement to encourage producers and consumers to choose the close loop system. The relationship between seller and buyer might need to shift as leaser and user to maintain materials recovery, recycling and remanufacture. Therefore, the policies need to be co-designed and should strongly support consumer engagement in making the shift. ",

However, IPEF  is expected to be different from conventional trade deals such as TPP. Other than the trade promotion, it also has other pillars including making the supply chain more resilient; promoting infrastructure and investment and clean energy; and forming new rules on taxation and anti-corruption.

The system accomplishes the job of predicting which posts a user is most likely to engage with better than a team of human experts ever could. It therefore joins a growing list of AI systems that can accomplish tasks that were previously reserved for humans at super-human levels. There are two dimensions of AI control: direct control - ability of the company or entity operating an AI system to exert sufficient control, i.e. to make sure the system does what the operator wants it to do. The social control problem reflects the difficulty of ensuring that an AI system acts in accordance with social norms.

            "Signal Description": "The 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) is mainly about digital technologies and automation. Bangladesh has a large industrial labour force. Experts indicate that the implications of 4IR on labour market are significant. The Readymade Garment (RMG) sector employs nearly 4.22 million people, of whom 2.5 million are women, working across 5,000 factories (UNCDF, 2021). Women garment workers are employed in comparatively lower-skilled and less-secure jobs than their male counterparts. Therefore, Due to skills mismatch, the push for 4IR-led productivity poses a threat of unemployment to the women. It could also leave women garment workers behind. ",

A growing tolerance is seen in the country for protecting the rights transgender community. In 2022, the 'Anti-Discrimination Bill 2022' is placed in the parliament for further examination. Section 3 of the proposed law recognizes the discrimination against transgender people. Very recently, the country has elected its first transgender mayor. However, their inheritance right is still unprotected in the country. // Following a Non-Discrimination Dialogue co-hosted by UNDP Lao PDR, the Ministry of Justice and CSOs, a Press Release was submitted to media outlets to publish. The Vientiane Times aggressively disregarded this material, citing the promotion of transgender persons. // Openness of government to discuss challenges faced by to LGBTQI (first government hosted Dialogue on LGBTQI in June 2022) // The conversation on rights and policies for LGBTIQ+ are discussed among the candidates of Bangkok Governors in the show. One of the candidate has unintentionally used a word to shown his segregation mindset towards LGBTIQ+. Then the host and other candidates took it as unacceptable mindset and try to correct him about his understanding towards gender equality.\n\nSeveral policies on genders were also shown during the Bangkok Governor election. // Proud to Be Us Laos, a civil society organization supported by a number of development agencies and partners posted on 17 May commending a range of organizations for openly supporting diversity, inclusion and acceptance for this international day. For the first time, LocaLaos Taxi company (the largest in the country) and Laotian Times (largest media outlet) posted support for this day. // On 5 June 2022, LGBTQ community celebrated their first Pride parade in almost 16 years. Bangkok's \"Naruemit Pride 2022\" -- Naruemit means \"creation\" in Thai -- was organised by a coalition of non-governmental groups with the city's newly ratified Governor Chadchart Sittipunt also throwing his weight behind it. Diverse calls for equal rights were expressed in the parade e.g. LGBTQIAN+ rights, same-sex marriage, sex work, sex toys, BDSM, etc. ",

Fiscal revenue growth plunged to -39.8 percent y/y in April from -3.8 percent y/y in March, while fiscal expenditure growth slowed to 1.7 percent y/y in April from 23.1 percent y/y in March despite proactive fiscal policies.  The deceleration in fiscal revenue growth was driven by a large contraction in tax revenues due mainly to large-scale VAT rebates and escalated Covid restrictions. Non-tax revenues held up better thanks to the profit transfer from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). Meanwhile, the contraction in revenues from land sales steepened further in April. The year-to-date fiscal deficit widened to 1.7 percent of GDP in April, compared to a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in the same period last year.",
