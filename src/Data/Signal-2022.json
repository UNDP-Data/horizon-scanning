This led to the AI developing its own non-human language. While more research will be carried out to establish whether models can learn to share negotiation strategies across domains, this development demonstrates how AI is redefining people's understanding of many realms formerly believed to be exclusively human. AI is increasingly explored by UNDP - in partnership with a consortium of tech companies, academic experts and NGOs - to help achieve the SDGs and shape our future of work. Hence, in line with the updated UNDP Digital Strategy (2022-2025), it is important to closely monitor these developments to identify risks and opportunities for UNDP to engage.",

    "Signal Description": "Climate change impacts are driving school drop-out rates in Bangladesh, as many children become laborers. A UNICEF report published in August 2021, noted that children in the South Asian countries of Bangladesh, Afghanistan and India are at ‘extremely high’ risk from climate change impacts. In Bangladesh, populations living in low-lying areas are particularly exposed and often highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change including increasing flooding, storms and erosion; many are forced to migrate to elsewhere in Bangladesh such as the slums of Dhaka. Children may be unable to attend school due to family financial struggles, and instead become laborers. Children’s education may also be disrupted by school closures as a result of damages to school infrastructure from hazards. According to UNICEF, the highest proportion of children who do not attend primary education in Bangladesh live in urban slums or remote and hazard-prone areas. A lack of education can restrict future opportunities for children, and lead to intergenerational cycles of poverty and child labor. This is highly relevant to UNDP given that child labor is a human rights issue, and alternative employment generation initiatives should be explored.",

As schools began reopening in May 2022, experts acknowledged that the emotional needs of children must be addressed as they transitioned back into on-site learning. Authorities should understand that COVID-19 is both a health and an economic issue. Children may therefore be feeling stressed as their families struggle with financial burdens and the burdens of everyday life. Many children have had to drop out of school due to the expense, and to earn money for their family’s survival. As of 2021, Thailand had 7.2 million children of school age. Of these, 1.9 million were at risk of drifting away from school. Many of these dropouts will end up as unskilled workers, trapped by poverty throughout their lives in a cycle that will be repeated by their children. To reduce this risk, it is necessary to provide scholarships, food, advice, and financial support. The Student Loan Fund could provide interest-free loans for children to continue their studies. Whilst most school dropouts eventually return to education, many will still drift away if they don’t receive the support they require.",

For example, in November 2021, Bangladesh elected their first transgender mayor. In 2022, discrimination against transgender people was recognised in the ‘Anti-Discrimination Bill 2022’ which is currently under examination by parliament. In June 2022, Bangkok celebrated its first LGBTQ+ pride parade in over 16 years, supported by the Governor Chadchart Sittipunt. In Lao PDR, a civil society organization ‘Proud to Be Us’ commended a range of organizations for openly supporting diversity, inclusion, and acceptance. However, not all signals point to a growing acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community. Lao PDR media outlet ‘The Vientaine Times’ aggressively disregarded a press release submitted following a Non-Discrimination Dialogue co-hosted by UNDP Lao PDR, the Ministry of Justice and CSOs, citing the material as promoting transgender persons. These signals are highly relevant to UNDP’s work on gender equality and human rights. UNDP has the opportunity to advocate gender diversity and equality through policy implementation and programming.

    "Signal Description (old)": "Bangladesh is home to an estimated 1.5 million transgender people who face discrimination and violence and are often forced to live by begging or working in the sex trade. A growing tolerance is seen in the country for protecting the rights transgender community. In 2022, the 'Anti-Discrimination Bill 2022' is placed in the parliament for further examination. Section 3 of the proposed law recognizes the discrimination against transgender people. Very recently, the country has elected its first transgender mayor. However, their inheritance right is still unprotected in the country. // Following a Non-Discrimination Dialogue co-hosted by UNDP Lao PDR, the Ministry of Justice and CSOs, a Press Release was submitted to media outlets to publish. The Vientiane Times aggressively disregarded this material, citing the promotion of transgender persons. // Openness of government to discuss challenges faced by to LGBTQI (first government hosted Dialogue on LGBTQI in June 2022) // The conversation on rights and policies for LGBTIQ+ are discussed among the candidates of Bangkok Governors in the show. One of the candidate has unintentionally used a word to shown his segregation mindset towards LGBTIQ+. Then the host and other candidates took it as unacceptable mindset and try to correct him about his understanding towards gender equality.\n\nSeveral policies on genders were also shown during the Bangkok Governor election. // Proud to Be Us Laos, a civil society organization supported by a number of development agencies and partners posted on 17 May commending a range of organizations for openly supporting diversity, inclusion and acceptance for this international day. For the first time, LocaLaos Taxi company (the largest in the country) and Laotian Times (largest media outlet) posted support for this day. // On 5 June 2022, LGBTQ community celebrated their first Pride parade in almost 16 years. Bangkok's \"Naruemit Pride 2022\" -- Naruemit means \"creation\" in Thai -- was organised by a coalition of non-governmental groups with the city's newly ratified Governor Chadchart Sittipunt also throwing his weight behind it. Diverse calls for equal rights were expressed in the parade e.g. LGBTQIAN+ rights, same-sex marriage, sex work, sex toys, BDSM, etc.",
    "Impact/ Relevance UNDP": "As UNDP work on the areas of gender equality and human rights, protecting transgenders’ right could be a potential area for UNDP’s advocacy initiatives in Bangladesh. Also, on the ground, UNDP Banglades can focus on building the capacity of the transgender community at a different scale to enhance their skills. UNDP could engage transgender people in their existing projects and programmes. Also, UNDP could sensitize communities to accept transgenders' presence in different employment sectors. Not taking timely initiatives may hinder UNDP’s efforts to reduce all forms of inequalities. // Although predominant media outlets in the country openly posted support for LGBTQI+ persons for Pride Month in June, this indicates underlying transphobia in corporate settings and at a State level. This lack of media coverage for trans persons may leave this group more vulnerable to anti-trans media coverage or lack of visibility. This is important to UNDP, as future programming and messaging on LGBTQI+ solidarity and advocacy may be compromised by a lack of media support. // Non-discrimination and human rights protection work // Opportunity on to advocate gender diversity/ gender equality through policy implementation // Demonstrates the increasing support of the private sector for LGBTQI+ rights. // Promotion of inclusiveness",

Experts indicate that the implications of 4IR on labour market are significant. The Readymade Garment (RMG) sector employs nearly 4.22 million people, of whom 2.5 million are women, working across 5,000 factories (UNCDF, 2021). Women garment workers are employed in comparatively lower-skilled and less-secure jobs than their male counterparts. Therefore, Due to skills mismatch, the push for 4IR-led productivity poses a threat of unemployment to the women. It could also leave women garment workers behind.",
    "Impact/ Relevance UNDP": "UNDP aims to achieve inclusive and sustainable economic development. UNDP Bangladesh envisions that more people in Bangladesh, particularly the most vulnerable and marginalized groups benefit from equitable economic development. However, the lack of proper safeguarding measures and skills development approaches will decrease women's employment in the RMG sector. 4IR will negatively impact their living standards, decision making and leadership capacity. Therefore, looking at this issue is critically important for UNDP.",

Research in Fiji and the Solomon Islands identified challenges for youths in the disconnect between the aims and outputs of formal education, dissuasion from engagement in critical thinking and civic engagement, and inertia to addressing youth issues through policy and programming based on evidence. To address Pacific and global challenges including the climate crisis, increasing geopolitical contestation, and COVID-19 recovery in a long-term, sustainable manner will require policies and programming that develops human and social capital around their young people, and is therefore relevant to UNDP. Pacific youth will be vital to the success of the social, economic, and environmental development of their communities, countries, and cultures.",

However, river supplies have also diminished to a level with only a few parallels in Pakistan’s history–the country having not received any rain since January. Most dams in Pakistan were built pre-1975, few having been built since despite warnings of water insecurity. The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in Pakistan predict that by 2035, Pakistan will have transitioned from a water-stressed to a water-scarce country. Food insecurity is also a major challenge, contributed to by a heavy reliance on wheat imports and political instability/ war in the Black Sea region prompting rising wheat prices.

Wildfires have the ability to destroy sensitive and carbon-rich ecosystems, and as such, wildfires and climate change are mutually exacerbating. Wildfires also have significant impacts for human health, watershed pollution, contamination, waste, and economic loss. The paper calls for a shift in government investment from wildfire response and recovery to prevention and preparedness.

    "Signal Description (old)": "The pandemic has accelerated adoption of digital tools and solutions. During the lockdowns, most of government services has moved online including critical services such as health, education and financial service. This has revealed the digital divide between rural and urban Bhutan and between the rich and the poor. More importantly it has widened the digital divide pushing the vulnerable segments of society towards margins of development landscape. \"As adoption of technology and digitalization acceleratedduring the COVID-19 pandemic, a rising trend in digital divide emerged in the country--between urban and rural, and between the rich and the poor. This is not a one off situation, digitalization is here is stay. The Central Bank's announcement to pilot Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is testament to the pace at which technology is penetrating the Bhutanese economy and citizens.� Why is it important? Very critical for UNDP's work around poverty reduction, inclusivity, governance. \"With majority of government services particularly around education, health and finance moving online, we observed a deepening in digital divide with rural communities and vulnerable segments of society unable to avail those services. If left unaddressed, it will impact access to opportunities--economic, social, technological, and employment in the long run risking the achievement of the SDGs and the objective of leaving no one behind.",

Previously seen as an issue on its own, currently it is seen more for it�s crosscutting connection with every aspect of life and society and it�s enabling role in sustainable development and societal transformation. More initiatives are being rolled out especially the foundational elements like digital identity. Regulations which have been non-existent or ignored for years (data protection and privacy bill, electronic transactions bill, Cyber security bill) are being drafted. Despite accelerated efforts on 'Digital', there still appears to be lack of consistency and consensus on how the country achieves this transformation. What is the best form of digital identity for the country? No consensus at the top ranks or among different agencies. The government is also still catching up to the latest developments on the tech front. For example, last week some tourist resorts have started accepting crypto currencies.  Far from having the regulations in place, national relevant agencies admitted to not being aware of this.  Why is it important? UNDP CO's next Country Program document  has identified digital as a key enabler for all its outcome areas. The CO needs to understand the lay of the land and be clear of it�s value offer in this area. While the government is still figuring this out, UNDP CO also needs to build it's capacities and consolidate it's offer, tailored to the country needs. // Covid 19 brought most public service delivery processes to a standstill, which highlighted the need for rapid digital transformation within the public sector. this is evidenced by a push to establish online access to services, provide digital forms of documentation such as a digital vaccination card. Also evidenced by efforts to digitalise services provided by the Dept. of Motor Traffic, Ministry of Education and others. Why is it important? Digital Transformation is a key strategic priority for UNDP with efforts being made within the organisation itself to further digitalise. UNDP across the region, and especially in Sri Lanka is championing Digital Transformation within the public and other sectors. The push to digitalise essential services in Sri Lanka as part of the country's COVID 19 response is indicative of high level buy in and the possibility of long term investment in these processes as well as a genuine desire to re-engineer processes and transform institutions. This also signals a shift in how essential services are provided to the public and made more equitable and accessible, ensuring that they reach the furthest behind and are, as always, designed and implemented in ways that are primarily citizen-centric.",

    "Signal Description (old)": "Context: Maldives identifies itself as a 100% muslimcountry, leaving little room for other religions. Within this space different versions of Islam exist from liberal to conservative to extreme. There are signs the gap between these versions are getting wider. Signals from the past: The rise of violent extremism came out as a strong signal in recent years.  In 2012, a member of parliament and religious scholar was murdered by local extremist groups. Another brutal murder of a journalist/activist in 2017 and a number of Maldivians joining the war in Syria and Afghanistan amplified this signal.In May 2021, former president Nasheed was critically injured in a bomb attack.  September 2021 a sitting MP talked about religious freedom in the country at a parliament session and went on to allege that international terror networks are operating in some islands. In response multiple island/local councils issued statements condemning his words and calling for his arrest. The response from institutions and the public at large Indicates a weak signal of the wideninggap between conservative and liberal versions of Islam and inability to engage in healthy dialogue on this issue.  Why is it important? In the past 5 years UNDP CO has been working on preventing violent extremism (PVE) and promoting social cohesion under the Governance portfolio.  UNDP�s main focus is on the prevention side while other entities focus on other aspects like deradicalization.The recent events maybe a weak signal of the continued tensions under the surface.  Violent extremism is a complex problem. Does UNDP or the government need to rethink their understanding of this problem and current approaches?",

During Covid-19 pandemic, for the first time ever a trend in reverse migration was observed. Several news medias and social media channels highlighted stories of people leaving the city to move back to the islands. The reasons for different individuals varied. For many, loss of income meant they could not afford the high rental cost in Male. However, for others, after months of lockdown, they simply craved a simpler and more connected way of life; connected to people/family,  connected to nature and community. Some were able to find employment or livelihood opportunities in the islands, while only few in certain professions (like IT and creative industries) managed to work out remote working arrangements. All were happy with their decisions to move to the islands. The reactions and comments to these stories indicated many yearned to make this choice but were afraid that they would not have access to jobs or have to still rely on Male for higher education or healthcare, the very reasons that first forced them to migrate to the city. Why is it important? While there is a trend for reverse migration observed, little is being done to harness this as an opportunity. There is human capital being moved to the local communities. Policies and interventions are not there to ensure sustainable livelihoods, access to quality services and infrastructure. Given the population density in the capital region and the dispersed nature of rest of the population, much like government policy, UNDP Programming has also been more focused on the capital region and central government. During CPD national consultations with stakeholders, it was highlighted that how UNDP engages and works with local communities needs rethinking.

Water disruptions affect the livelihood of producers directly i.e. farmers, manufacturers, and the jobs they support, potentially exacerbating poverty and inequality. Moreover, poor planning and poor management of development trade-offs can exacerbate inequality for certain categories of citizens in terms of quality or life and vulnerability to natural disasters. Weak regulations and poor enforcement of polluters in turn continue the vicious cycle.",
